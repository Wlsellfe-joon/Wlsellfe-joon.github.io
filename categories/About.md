Hello, "Wlsellfe joon" is the name I chose for my blog with the intention of living a wise life. However, I intentionally mixed the letters 'L' and 'I' for visibility.

On the blog, I aim to share my experiences, study materials, and knowledge. Deep learning, automotive security, and artificial intelligence security are the main interests, and studies will mostly cover topics like C, C++, Python, and C#. Paper reviews and debugging records from my graduate school days will also be part of the content.

In an era where artificial intelligence demonstrates exceptional performance, it may seem challenging to decide what content to cover. However, I believe sharing experiences and collective intelligence hold value beyond artificial intelligence.

Have a great time! Thank you.
